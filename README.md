# RouletteFuck

RouletteFuck is a derivative of the esoteric programming language Brainfuck, designed to introduce a layer of unpredictability into the programming experience. This language operates under a unique execution model, wherein each command has a one in six chance of being executed at any given point in the program. This model is inspired by the randomness and risk associated with Russian roulette, hence the name RouletteFuck.

### Technical Overview

At its core, RouletteFuck retains the minimalistic command set of Brainfuck, consisting of the eight original commands: `> < + - . , [ ]` ([guide](https://gist.github.com/roachhd/dce54bec8ba55fb17d3a)). However, when a RouletteFuck program runs, the interpreter randomly selects one out of every six commands to execute. This stochastic nature introduces a significant element of chance, affecting not only the flow of execution but also the strategies for program design.

To accommodate the randomness and to enhance the likelihood of a RouletteFuck program executing as intended, an innovative compiler accompanies the language. This compiler preprocesses RouletteFuck code by duplicating each character six times, aligning with the one-in-six execution chance. This preprocessing step is critical, as it maximizes the probability that each intended command is executed at least once in its group of six, thereby ensuring a closer adherence to the programmer's original intent.

### Usage

Before executing a Brainfuck program with the RouletteFuck interpreter, you can optionally convert your `.bf` file into a `.rf` file using the compiler. 

Example command to compile `yourprogram.bf` to `yourprogram.rf`:

```
./compiler yourprogram.bf
```
or
```
python3 compiler.py yourprogram.bf
```

This command reads `yourprogram.bf`, processes it, and generates `yourprogram.rf`, where each Brainfuck command is duplicated six times to suit the RouletteFuck execution model.

Note: Due to the randomness of command execution, loop behaviors (`[` and `]`) may work unpredictably. Programmers are advised to design their programs with this variability in mind.

With your `.rf` file ready, you can now execute it using the RouletteFuck interpreter.

**Run the RouletteFuck Interpreter**: To execute your RouletteFuck program, use the interpreter with the `.rf` file as its argument.

```
./interpreter yourprogram.rf
```

This stochastic approach encourages the development of robust, fault-tolerant software, as programmers must anticipate and plan for a range of possible outcomes, rather than a single, deterministic path. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of comprehensive testing and debugging strategies, skills that are critically important in software development at large. In essence, RouletteFuck's randomness is a pedagogical tool, sharpening programmers' abilities to deal with ambiguity and complexity, thereby preparing them for the challenges of modern computing tasks.
